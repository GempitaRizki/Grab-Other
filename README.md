The concept involved between client and server in the code example above is the basic concept of developing web applications using a server-side approach (server-side).

In this concept, the server acts as a service provider that receives requests from clients and sends responses back to clients. The client can be a web browser, mobile app, or any other application that can send HTTP requests.

<h2>In the code sample above, the Python application acts as a server running a web server using Flask.</h2> 
When a client accesses a specific URL on the server (eg '/' or '/about'), the server calls the appropriate function (such as home() or about()) and returns a response to the client.

On the client side, the client (eg web browser) sends an HTTP request to the appropriate URL on the server and waits for a response from the server. The response will be content such as text, HTML, displayed JSON, or other data type, which the client will or uses as needed.

> So, the concept involved between client and server in the code example above is the interaction between the server as a service provider and the client as a service user who sends requests and receives responses.

Finally I was able to finish it within a day helped by some sumbeh, yeay!! :yawning_face:	

It's just that there is still one function that is still lacking, 'client' defined.
